    "## LinkedList\n",
    "There isn't a built-in data structure in Python that looks like a linked list. Thankfully, it's easy to make classes that represent data structures in Python! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code for an Element, which will be a single unit in a linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Element(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "Make sure you understand this code before moving on! We use __init__ to initialize a new Element. An Element has some value associated with it (which could be anything—a number, a string, a character, et cetera), and it has a variable that points to the next element in the linked list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's set up a LinkedList class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class LinkedList(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, head=None):\n",
    "        self.head = head\n",
    "This code is very similar—we're just establishing that a LinkedList is something that has a head Element, which is the first element in the list. If we establish a new LinkedList without a head, it will default to None. \n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Let's add a method to our LinkedList to make it a little more useful. This method will add a new Element to the end of our LinkedList.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def append(self, new_element):\n",
    "        current = self.head\n",
    "        if self.head:\n",
    "            while current.next:\n",
    "                current = current.next\n",
    "            current.next = new_element\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.head = new_element\n",
    "Again, this part is really important, so don't rush through it. Take the code line-by-line and make sure everything makes sense. If the LinkedList already has a head, iterate through the next reference in every Element until you reach the end of the list. Set next for the end of the list to be the new_element. Alternatively, if there is no head already, you should just assign new_element to it and do nothing else."
